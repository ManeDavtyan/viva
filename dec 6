To analyze the HTTP host column based on usage, particularly focusing on upload and download data, you can follow these steps:

Summary Statistics:

You've provided summary statistics for both the "Upload" and "Download" columns. These statistics give you an overall understanding of the distribution of the data.
Visualization:

Visualize the distribution of "Upload" and "Download" using histograms or box plots. This will help you understand the spread of the data and identify any outliers.
python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Histogram for Upload
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Upload'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Upload Data Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Upload')
plt.show()

# Histogram for Download
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['Download'], bins=50, kde=True)
plt.title('Download Data Distribution')
plt.xlabel('Download')
plt.show()
Outliers:

Identify and analyze outliers in both "Upload" and "Download" columns. Outliers can significantly impact the mean and standard deviation.
python
Copy code
# Box plot for Upload
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x=df['Upload'])
plt.title('Upload Data Boxplot')
plt.xlabel('Upload')
plt.show()

# Box plot for Download
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x=df['Download'])
plt.title('Download Data Boxplot')
plt.xlabel('Download')
plt.show()
Top Hosts by Usage:

Identify the top hosts based on both upload and download data. This can give insights into which hosts contribute the most to your network traffic.
python
Copy code
top_upload_hosts = df.groupby('HttpHost')['Upload'].sum().nlargest(10)
top_download_hosts = df.groupby('HttpHost')['Download'].sum().nlargest(10)

print("Top Upload Hosts:\n", top_upload_hosts)
print("\nTop Download Hosts:\n", top_download_hosts)
Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, you can draw conclusions about the distribution of upload and download data, identify outliers, and understand the hosts that contribute the most to the network traffic.
Remember to replace df with your actual DataFrame variable. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary libraries installed (matplotlib, seaborn).
